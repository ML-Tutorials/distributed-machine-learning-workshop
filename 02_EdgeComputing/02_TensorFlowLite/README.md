# TensorFlow Lite

TensorFlow lite is an edge-computing solution for the Android platform. For teams working with TensorFlow or Keras taht are deploying principally to Android, this is a turnkey solution with which one can integrate a TensorFlow model into an app to make inferences.

The demo app used in this presentation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite/java/demo/app) courtesy of the TensorFlow team.  Documentation for this project can be found on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/mobile/tflite/demo_android).
