# Core ML

Core ML allows for Machine Learning algorithms to be ported to iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.

The demo app used in this presentation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/shu223/iOS-10-Sampler) courtesy of Shuichi Tsutsumi.  The Inception Network is written in Swift by Apple using the Core ML Framework.  The weights for the model come from a network pretrained on the ImageNet2012 dataset.
