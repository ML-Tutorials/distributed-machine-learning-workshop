# Amazon Greengrass

Outside of the datacenter, the most common version of distributed Machine Learning is edge computing, in which pretrained models are deployed to edge computing devices, like cars or IoT telemetric devices.  The models are used to make inference on the devices, allowing for self-driving cars or self-regulating propulsion of ship fleets.

We will build a Machine Learning model on [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and use [Amazon Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/ml/) running on a Raspberry Pi to do inference.
