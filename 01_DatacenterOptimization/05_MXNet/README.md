# MXNet

MXNet is developed by the [Distributed (Deep) Machine Learning Community](https://github.com/dmlc), or DMLC, the world's largest non-profit Distributed Machine Learning community with industrial support from most of the major players in Machine Learning.  Based in China, their most popular library - [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) - is currently part of the Apache Incubator.

We will look at the MXNet [image classification example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/image-classification), which trains on the [Place 365 challenge dataset](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html) that is comprised of approximately 20 million images.  We will distribute this over 4 machines.
